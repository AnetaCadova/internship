Programming is all about practice, knowledge and experience. There are many places
where you can train your skills
    - https://code-exercises.com/programming/easy/
    - https://www.codingame.com/home

You write some code, submit it and the page runs some tests to evaluate your solution.

1. Create new maven project, lets call it "Challenges"
2. Add dependencies for junit and assertj
3. Select some easy challenges (at least 3) from the first mentioned page and for every challenge do the following:
    - pass the challenge on the page first
    - transfer the solution to your project
        - create a separate class for every challenge
    - create a test class for the challenge and implement tests
        - think about different test cases
        - think about edge cases
        - the tests should only pass if the solution is correct
            - you can play with the solution once the tests are ready to see if it fails with incorrect solution
    - every challenge and its tests should be commited to the task05 git branch in one single commit

4. Debugging your code
    - what is debugging?
    - what is a breakpoint?
    - how do you run the code in debug mode in your IntelliJ IDEA?
    - what is the difference between "step over" and "step into" when debugging?
    - try to debug the challenges you created

5. Run all the tests you created from command line via mvn command
    - how do you run only a specific test class?
    - how do you run just a specific test method inside that class?
