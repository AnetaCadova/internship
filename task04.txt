1. Install IntelliJ IDEA
    - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux

2. In IntelliJ IDEA create a new maven project
    - IDEA asked you to fill some fields - how are they later used in the project?

3. What is JUnit?
    - add junit maven dependency to your project
    - create a test class with simple test method with body: `Assert.assertEquals(1, 2);`
        - the test class should have name which ends with "Test", why?
        - how do you run the test from IDEA?
        - how do you run the test from command line?
        - fix the test so it passes
        - how would you change the code so you do not have to use `Assert.` before assertEquals?

4. Get familiar with IDEA
    - how do you change java version for current project?
    - how do you change java version for all future projects?
    - learn basic shortcuts
        - one line comment
        - block comment
        - auto-format
        - optimize imports
        - go back to previous cursor position

5. Add newest version of assertj dependency to your project
    - https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.assertj/assertj-core
    - what are main advantages of assertj in comparison with junit Assert?
    - find out how to create simple assertions and change your test to use assertj
        - https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-features-highlight.html
    - create more tests
        - play with other assertj testing functions
        - feel free to create an object class and try some basic tests with it
